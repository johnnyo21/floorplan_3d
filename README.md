<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

<h3>First things first, you will need a 3d model of your home. </h3>
<p>An eazy way to get started is with <a href="https://www.sweethome3d.com/">Sweet Home 3D (FREE SOFTWARE)</a> - Google some tutorials or videos to help you get started.
<br />
Alternatively, you can use any other 3d design software as long as you can export your models in (.OBJ / .MTL) format.</p>

### Prerequisites

Once you have the model of your home completed using Sweet Home 3D.
* (OPTIONAL) Navigate to 3D view --> Modify 3D view --> Walls transparency --> Drag the Slider slightly to the right to add a little transparency to your models walls.
* Navigate to 3D view --> Export to OBJ format --> Save the files (OBJ - Wavefront) to a folder on your computer. (Save as floorplan.obj or something similar)
* Confirm you now see in this folder floorplan.obj, floorplan.mtl and any texture image files associated with your model.
* Access the www folder inside of home assistant. Create a new folder inside of this directory and copy all of these files over `/www/floorplan/YOUR_EXPORTED_FILES`
